    Modern cultivated tetraploid cottons contain two species, Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium hirsutum. Among them, G. hirsutum is the significant species cultivated worldwide and contributes more than 90% natural fiber for the industry. To completely reveal the genetic diversity and population divergence within cultivated tetraploid cotton, we resequenced more than 1,700 accessions, which mostly included the South-China landraces, the elite introgression lines, and the obsoleted historic varieties. After integrating them with the major public resequencing data (PRJNA257154, PRJNA336461, PRJNA375965, PRJNA399050, and PRJNA414461), we obtained a whole Genebank variation map contained 3,248 tetraploid cottons (included 2,922 G. hirsutum). This variation map covered more than 1/3 of current G. hirsutum Genebank in China (~9,000 accessions), which could represent the genetic diversity of G. hirsutum.
